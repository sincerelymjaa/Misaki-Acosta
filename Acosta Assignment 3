"""
After running the code above, it will display the album version, poster image, photocard version (which shows the name of the K-Pop Idol), photobook page, and track played on the album CD.
I made five album variations to show the randomness of the inclusions that come with every K-Pop Album.
I am only describing the inclusions; hence, there is no numerical change or increase in value.

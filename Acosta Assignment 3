After running the code above, it will display the album version, poster image, photocard version (which shows the name of the K-Pop Idol), photobook page, and track played on the album CD.
I made five album variations to show the randomness of the inclusions that come with every K-Pop Album.
I am only describing the inclusions; hence, there is no numerical change or increase in value.

Regular Albums and Special Albums share attributes such as the album version, poster image, photocard version (which shows the name of the K-Pop Idol), photobook page, and track played on the album CD.
However, unlike the other Regular K-Pop Albums above, the Special Album has Pre-Order Benefits (POB). These Pre-Order benefits are rare; only those fans who ordered the album early or its limited version can have them.
The most common POBs are exclusive photocards and the video call benefit. The exclusive photocards contain a rare selfie taken by the K-Pop Idol. As for the video call benefit, fans who win this can interact with their K-Pop idol through a video call. 
As for the folder and sticker, it is usually a "limited edition" benefit for the K-Pop Album's Japan release.
Fans can only get these benefits if they purchase the album from a specific shop (like Makestar, Withmuu, etc.) or a CD store in Japan. 
However, the POB from one store differs from that from another store.
No POBs are the same from various stores.
